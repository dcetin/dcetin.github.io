I have been curious to see if there is any correlation between the ages of award winners in comparison to their respective nominees in well-known award ceremonies. I wanted to initially try my chance with Academy Awards as there is plenty of easily accessible data, but this same idea could be easily applied to many other competitions. The interactive plot below compares the ages of nominees and winners for the Academy Award for Best Director. Dataset and code to generate the plots can be found [here](https://github.com/dcetin/academy-awards).

This page currently serves as a placeholder and I am hoping to expand this by including a few more datasets in future and commenting/formatting it a little more nicely.
