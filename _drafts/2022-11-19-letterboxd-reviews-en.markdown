## Oslo, August 31st

One of the most human films I have ever watched. I felt the urge to listen closely, in hopes to understand and resolve the people in it. It was easy for me to relate to maybe every person in this movie —both sides of all the dialogue— but I could not see myself coming to terms with these feelings, theirs and mine. What breaks me the most is this. One day was not enough, a lifetime won't be either.

I believe Trier accomplished what he wanted when he imagined a "poetry of the seemingly unimportant everyday moments". The film is woven with intimate dialogues and very well-timed silences. I would not want to downplay other actors, but obviously Anders Danielsen Lie alone carries most of the film’s weight on his shoulders. He adds noteworthy details to the character through his way of speaking and his facial expressions, especially his broken smile.

## The Bakery Girl of Monceau

I very much envy how people in Rohmer's films have plenty of time to ponder and pursue love.

A pleasant introduction to Rohmer’s cinema, with a grounded and self-contained screenplay. The auteur skillfully both shows and tells: voiceover narration adds a layer to the relationships of the characters and the film easily reads like a short story. I also enjoyed occasional close-ups that gave us more of the actors.
