Hi! My name is Doruk, I am a Deep Learning Engineer at [Arbrea Labs](https://arbrea-labs.com/). My research interests are understanding and modeling of humans, their surroundings and their actions through deep learning. I am especially interested in the applied side of XR.

I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University ([METU/ODTÃœ](https://www.metu.edu.tr)) in Ankara, Turkey.
In past, I have interned at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/), [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) in ETH Zurich, [iBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) in Imperial College London and [DIAS](https://dias.epfl.ch/) Laboratory in EPFL.

You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Other than that, I am into cinema, history, sci-fi and stuff. Do not hesitate to contact me, just shoot an email.
