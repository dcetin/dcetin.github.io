I am a Direct Doctorate student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html).
<!-- Currently I am working on my Master's thesis in Advanced Interactive Technollogies ([AIT](https://ait.ethz.ch)) Lab, under the supervision of Prof. Otmar Hilliges. -->
My current research interests are Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University ([METU/ODTÃœ](https://www.metu.edu.tr)) in Ankara, Turkey. In past, I have worked with [Data Analytics Lab](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch) in ETH Zurich, [iBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) in Imperial College London and [DIAS](https://dias.epfl.ch/) Laboratory in EPFL.

You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Other than that, I am into cinema, history, science fiction and stuff. Do not hesitate to [contact](/contact/) me, just shoot an email.
