Hi! My name is Doruk, I am a Research Engineer at [Align Technology](https://www.aligntech.com/). My research interests are understanding and modeling of humans, their surroundings and their actions through deep learning. I am especially interested in the applied side of XR.

I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University ([METU/ODTÃœ](https://www.metu.edu.tr)) in Ankara, Turkey.

Other than that, I am into cinema, history, sci-fi and stuff. Do not hesitate to contact me, just shoot an email.
