I am a Direct Doctorate student in [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), currently doing my Master's in Computer Science on Visual Computing. My current research interests are Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Before coming to ETH Zurich, I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University ([METU/ODTÃœ](https://www.metu.edu.tr)) in Ankara, Turkey. During my studies, I interned at the Prof. Anastasia Ailamaki's Data Intensive Applications and Systems ([DIAS](https://dias.epfl.ch/)) Laboratory in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) for one summer. I have also had the chance to work as an intern with the Prof. Maja Pantic's Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group ([iBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/)) in [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) the following summer.

You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Other than that, I am into cinema, history, science fiction and stuff. Do not hesitate to [contact](/contact/) me, just shoot an email.
