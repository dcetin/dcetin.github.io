I am a final year bachelor's student at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr), studying Computer Engineering. As of this september, I will be continuing my studies at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). My current research interests are Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Maybe you can't really see it right now, but my contact info is just at the bottom of this page. You can also find my CV [here](/cv/).
